	Added source files used for tests in the Kepler system.
	
	MainPanel: when null, sets saved_url according to saved_filename, so load()
	works properly. (The bug was that "Load" button in standalone MngViewer
	was not working.)
	
	For some reason the original job to connect via gvnetapi on geostream.cs
	didn't complete	properly as it does on the cipic.goes machine.
	So I decided for a simpler scheme on geostream.cs: The cronjob is now:
		50 * * * *   wget "http://casil.ucdavis.edu/~crueda/goes/saved_vis.jpg" \
							-O saved_vis.jpg
	So the saved image is grabbed every hour from goes.cipic.

02/09/05
	MainPanel.java: Different constructors depending on
	given saved file specificaction: filename or URL
	
	MngViewerApplet.java: Uses getCodeBase to specify the URL of
	saved file.
	
	Various .php files updated to work with paths relative to the location
	of the scripts.
	
	The applet is now working fine from:
		http://geostream.cs.ucdavis.edu/applet/applet.php

	cronjob also set up on geostream.cs; 
	Stript cronjob3h updated so it used a relative path to call gvnetapi2

	It seems, the PHP image library is not available in geostream.cs :-(
	(last.php/redim.php don't work -- no big deal anyway)
	
	
08/10/04	(from previous days)
	- I set up a crontab on goes.cipic to run `cronjob3h'
	  every three hours:
	      55 13,16,19,22,1,4,7,10 * * *   cronjob3h
	  
	  mngstream.jar is called with 
	     -delay 60    save every 60 seconds
		 -alive 35    keep alive for 35 minutes
		 
	  However I've seen that sometimes that the full scan finishes
	  beyond the alive period.
	  Well, a better solution would be to check for the (x,y) locations
	  to determine when a full scan has finished. To-DO.

	- MngStreamClient now makes a maximum number of unsuccessful 
	  reconnections. After that it exits.
	- MngStreamClient now binds a port so I can control that
	  at most one instance is running. I set up a cronjob that
	  (re)starts MngStreamClient every 5 minutes.
	- new last.php, redim.php to show last saved image.
	
07/27/04
	Memory leak is caused by ImageIO:
		0) Commenting all ImageIO.{read,write} calls:
			RES=29m (top report)
		1) With ImageIO.read only for the file on disk:
			RES=42m (13Mb difference!)
		2) 1) and ImageIO.read for each PNG
		   (see MngInputStream.nextPng):
			RES starts at 42m and increases steadily!!
		
	I'm now using incremental garbage collection ``-Xincgc'', and 
	the footprint seems to improve a bit..
	
	One more try: use directly a ImageReader object, so I can call
	ImageReader.dispose() --I found something related to this memory leak
	in the Sun Java bug database: ImageIO does not call dispose() properly.
	I'm not sure if this is the problem, but let's see..

	- Script ``run'' is now called just ``./run''
	  since ``./run stdin'' is unstable.

07/26/04
	- New thread ImageUpdater for better control.
	- MngStreamClient can now read the stream from stdin.
	- Script ``run'' is now called:  
	    ./run stdin

07/24/04
	- package structure for Java code:
		geostreams.goes:  GOESConstants
		geostreams.mngstream: Non-gui interface to download the mng stream
		geostreams.mngstream.applet: Code for the applet (replicated)
	- new build.xml
	- saved_vis.jpg is now updated on casil with the following:
	    nohup java -Djava.awt.headless=true -jar DIST/mngstream.jar -delay 120 &
	  (see `run' shell script)
	  
	- MainPanel.connect(): calls load() if a certain amount of time has
	  passed since the last load.

06/05/04
	- MngViewer can now run with no gui 
	  ==> NO, see MngStreamClient for a better way.
	- Red lines are drawn only as an applet.

06/02/04
	- jpg format chosen for saving complete image.
	- new MainPanel to allow for applets and apps.
	- new control.php and index.php.
	- automatic reconnection when getPng() returns null.
	- scroll bars updated.
	- applet on mozilla tested with more than 30K images without problems
	
05/29/04
	MngStream.cpp: SIGPIPE handled to terminate process if client
	ends connection.

05/28/04
	Scroll pane, zoom-in, zoom-out.
	
05/27/04
	save/load to store/restore current contents in png format.
	Note: the saved.png fails to open as an applet
	
05/26/04
	more tests to check mislocation.
	See MngStream.cpp: show_rows()
	
05/21/04
	- Corner points p0, p1 to create MngPanel
	- Is it necessary to reverse the bytes is the generated png image?
	  (see reverse_rows in MngStream.cpp)
	
05/18/04
	buttons: connect, stop
	
05/11/04
	MngViewer.java: first version
	MngViewerApplet.java: first version
	
05/10/04
	sample depth changed to 16.
	Due to some errors relating to not being able to write
	all requested bytes in my_write_data, I tried:
	   fdopen(fileno(stdout), "wb");
	and it's working. ;-)
	more tests needed, anyways
	
05/08/04
	initial version
