ELUG conversion readme

The Elug class provides methods that convert GOES line/pixel to lat/lon 
and vice versa.  

Elug calls functions in ELUG_C.c.  Attention: since we use C code for 
the C++ class, in the Makefile, gcc is used to compile both C and C++ 
files, but g++ has to be used to link objects.  Otherwise it would 
create problems.  

The following methods have to be called to set up the necessary parameters
to do the conversion.

	1. setRec(): passes the 336 O and A variables from GVAR block 0.
	2. setcons(): sets constants in common INSTCOMM. 
              !!! After the program starts to run, this method has to be
	          called again to set different constants whenever the
		  spacecraft is inverted back and forth. i.e. flipflag value 
	          is changed from 1 to -1 or from -1 to 1.
	3. time50(): gets the values of epoch and time for lmodel call.
	4. setFlipflag(): sets Flipflag value.
	5. setImc(): sets IMC value.
	6. setInstr(): sets Instrument Imager(1) or Sounder(2) 
	7. lmodel(): this methods calculates the value of subsatllite lat/lon.    
	
Now the class is ready to convert line/pixel or lat/lon for you.

	1. pl2ll() accepts pixel/line and return lat/lon in radiant.
	2. ll2pl() accepts lat/lon in radiant and return line/pixel.

Methods to get the subsatellite lat/lon:
	1. getSubsatLat() ;
        2. getSubsatLon() ;

Other methods:
	1. getEvln();
	2. getScpx();
	3. evln();
	4. scpx();

For debugging purpose: 

	Both methods pl2ll() and ll2pll() perform two steps.  The first step is
	pl2se() for pl2ll() and ll2se() for ll2pl(), which converts input to scan
	and elev values.  

	A comparison can be made to test if the first step is correct:
	1. After call pl2ll() or ll2pl(), users call
		getEvln() and getScpx() to get the values of elev and scan.
	2. Call evln() and scpx() directly to get the values of elev and scan.



  
"make testCplus" will create the executable 
testCplus. (not make !!!)
