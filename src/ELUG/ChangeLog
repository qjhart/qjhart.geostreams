Jul 18, 2005  testOne.cpp is fixed for both ll2pl and pl2ll
	      tests. One more test not in the ELUG DOC was
	      added into similartest.c.
	      
	      Default Rec array is added into the Elug constructor
	      for test purpose.  

	      The order of parameters of Elug methods are changed
	      to lon, lat and pixel, line.  

Jul 13, 2005  Comments are added into ELUG.h and ELUG.cpp
	      The package has tested all lat/lon and pixel/line
	      conversion cases as described in the ELUG 
	      document, and the results are all correct.  

Jul 11, 2005  This version gets rid of the connection between 
	      ELUG_C.[ch] and library lf2c.  The transformation
	      from lat/lon to pixel/line is added into the ELUG
	      methods. 
 
              Attention: lat/lon have to be converted to radiant 
	      values to be passed into ELUG.ll2pl(****).
