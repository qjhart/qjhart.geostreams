o Net-enabling Geostreams Scientific Workflows
----------------------------------------------

This module is based on an abstract concept of "workflow," that is, an external
interface to access the available streams in some concrete scientific workflow. 

Class NetInterface (in geostreams.ptolemy) offers an implementation that 
accesses the available streams in a Ptolemy model. This NetInterface is a 
Ptolemy component that can be inserted in a model to net-enable it.

Class SimpleWorkflow in (geostreams.workflow) is an implementation that uses a 
ServerConnection to export the streams in a geostream spec through the same interface. 

Both IWorkflow implementations make use of the mechanisms in the geostreams.workflow
package to provide the actual net-enabling capability (via a standard server).

geostreams.Client is a simple client GUI to test a net-enabled workflow. 
It can be used as a standalone program. 


* package geostreams.workflow:
Provides the "net-enabling" of workflows:
	interface IWorkflow          Interface for client code to interact with a workflow
	interface IWorkflowObserver  To notify client code about events in the workflow
	class WorkflowObserver       The observer of the view
	class NIManager              Main net-interface manager
	class NIServer               The server thread
	class RemoteClient           Server-side representation of a remote client
	class DispatchRemoteClient   Thread for dispatching a remote client

	class SimpleWorkflow         A command-line, non-interactive implementation 
	                             of IWorkflow backed on a ServerConnection.
	
* package geostreams.ptolemy:
Offers access to a Ptolemy model through the IWorkflow interface:
	class NetInterface           The ptolemy component implementing IWorkflow
	class PtUtils                Various ptolemy-related helper functions
		

		
o Geostreams Image package
--------------------------

TODO: reorganize

note:
	Even though that C++ based server protocol allows more than one channel to be
	requested in a single socket connection, this module restricts these
	requests to only ONE channel. This simplifies the design. Also, the canceling 
	of data reception can be done in a stream by stream basis.

package geostreams.image:
	This packages defines and handles images and image streams. The main supporting
	class here is ServerConnection, which manages a connection to a GeoStreams server
	via a specification in xml format.

TODO: it seems IServerConnection has some responsabilities that actually
	  belong to IImageStream...
