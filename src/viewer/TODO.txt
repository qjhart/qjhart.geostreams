  - Automatically update vector data according to changing 
    parameters in the gvar stream.

  - Aspect adjustment should be done only for visualization;
    eg., saved bg image would be a proportional reduction of 
    the original image size in both axes.
  	
  - Examine the design for new commands in vizstreams (besides the 
	current command line options) to connect to a new workflow server.
	  		  
  - Metadata: more info needs to be transmitted from the server.
    For example, for a timestamp, it'd be better to have that info
    from the gvar stream itself

  - Combine 3 channels into an RGB image following some standard
    color mappings to highlight vegetation and other characteristics..

  - Frame borders are not displayed in order of arrival
