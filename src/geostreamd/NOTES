OVERVIEW
--------

Client is poll-based for multiple clients.  I got ideas esp. basic
outline for polling and idea of linked free and busy connections from
http://www.mathopd.org/

Basic Idea is that on initialization, a fixed number of clients are
started.  Each has an associated fd with it.  All active clients get
'polled' in a single connection.  If any of them are active, then the
read and process happens.

TODO
----
Add Changelog
Add $ID$ info to code

Assumptions
-----------
Current Request is '\n' delimited
Client input is < CLIENT_INPUT_BUFFER_SIZE

LOG
---

Currently, I'm using syslog, rather than a standalone logger.  This
needs to be changed for Thursday's class.


CODE UGLINESS
-------------

Currently, I use server mostly like an object, but I also use it one
place as a global variable, for clients to add/sub themselves from
free/busy lists.  I should really do one or the other probably,
clients couldj of course point back to the server, but we will have
multiple servers?

Presumably epoll is better, but I'm planning on using poll as the
event monitor for the system.  I would like to use epoll instead,
however, This is only in 2.5 kernels, so I'm not sure it's kosher.
Will have to ask.

SPEED
-----
I make function calls while debugging, this could be compiled out for
better speed.
